Project to study docker
🚀 Docker Roadmap for a .NET Developer
Goal: Achieve "excellent knowledge in Docker" for .NET applications.

📅 Total Duration: ~2-3 Months (Flexible)

📌 Phase 1: Docker Basics (Week 1-2)
🎯 Goal: Understand fundamental Docker concepts and run .NET apps in containers.

🔹 Topics to Learn
✅ What is Docker? Containers vs. VMs
✅ Installing Docker Desktop (Windows/Linux/macOS)
✅ Basic Docker commands (run, ps, stop, rm, logs, exec)
✅ Creating and running a simple .NET console app in Docker
✅ Writing a Dockerfile for a .NET 6 Web API
✅ Understanding container networking
✅ Using .dockerignore to optimize builds

🛠️ Hands-on Practice
🔹 Run hello-world container and inspect it.
🔹 Write a Dockerfile for a basic .NET Core Web API.
🔹 Bind ports (e.g., docker run -p 8080:80 myapp).
🔹 Inspect container logs (docker logs <container_id>).

📌 Phase 2: Intermediate - Multi-Container Apps (Week 3-4)
🎯 Goal: Work with multiple containers and persist data.

🔹 Topics to Learn
✅ Multi-stage builds (reducing image size)
✅ Using Docker Compose for multi-container applications
✅ Connecting a .NET Web API to a SQL Server/PostgreSQL container
✅ Persistent storage with Docker Volumes
✅ Environment variables & secrets management

🛠️ Hands-on Practice
🔹 Build a .NET API + PostgreSQL using Docker Compose.
🔹 Store logs inside a mounted volume (-v flag).
🔹 Create a custom Docker network and connect multiple services.

📌 Phase 3: Advanced - Optimization & CI/CD (Week 5-6)
🎯 Goal: Optimize Docker images and integrate with CI/CD pipelines.

🔹 Topics to Learn
✅ Using minimal images (Alpine, Slim)
✅ Implementing health checks in Dockerfile
✅ Container security (scanning vulnerabilities, non-root users)
✅ Caching layers in Docker builds (COPY --from=builder)
✅ CI/CD: Building & pushing images to Docker Hub/Azure Container Registry
✅ Deploying a containerized .NET app to Azure Container Apps

🛠️ Hands-on Practice
🔹 Reduce image size with multi-stage builds.
🔹 Automate Docker builds using GitHub Actions.
🔹 Push images to Docker Hub / Azure Container Registry.
🔹 Deploy a .NET API container to Azure Container Instances.

📌 Phase 4: Kubernetes & Advanced Orchestration (Week 7-8)
🎯 Goal: Deploy and manage containers in Kubernetes.

🔹 Topics to Learn
✅ Running Kubernetes locally (minikube, kind)
✅ Deploying a .NET API in Kubernetes (kubectl apply)
✅ Managing pods, services, deployments
✅ Scaling with replicas and load balancing
✅ Using Helm charts for .NET apps
✅ Logging & monitoring containers (Prometheus, Grafana)

🛠️ Hands-on Practice
🔹 Deploy a .NET API in Kubernetes (local cluster).
🔹 Configure auto-scaling with replicas.
🔹 Expose a Kubernetes service externally.

📌 Phase 5: Real-World Project (Final Month)
🎯 Goal: Apply everything in a real-world scenario.

🔹 Build a Microservices App
✅ API Gateway + Microservices architecture
✅ Message queue integration (RabbitMQ, Kafka)
✅ Caching (Redis, MemoryCache)
✅ Deploying to a cloud-based Kubernetes cluster

🛠️ Final Project (Full-Stack Example)
🔹 Build a microservices-based .NET API in Docker.
🔹 Implement RabbitMQ for event-driven architecture.
🔹 Deploy to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

📌 Bonus: Stay Up to Date
🔹 Follow Docker & Kubernetes blogs
🔹 Contribute to open-source projects
🔹 Share knowledge via LinkedIn/Medium posts
🔹 Earn Docker certifications (DCA - Docker Certified Associate)
